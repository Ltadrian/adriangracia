Lyrics 

escape
-
as i'm looking at the time
feels like
i'm losing here

i can escape
with you
with you

flashes of movements
instant moments caught
in a single scene

as i'm looking at the time
feels like
i'm losing air

i can escape
with you
with you

i can escape
with you
with you

i can escape
with you
with you
