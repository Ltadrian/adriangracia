Lyrics 

escape
-
as i'm looking at the time <br/>
feels like <br/>
i'm losing here <br/>

i can escape <br/>
with you <br/>
with you <br/>

i can escape <br/>
with you <br/>
with you <br/>

flashes of movements <br/>
instant moments caught <br/>
in a single scene <br/>

as i'm looking at the time <br/>
feels like <br/>
i'm losing air <br/>

i can escape <br/>
with you <br/>
with you <br/>

i can escape <br/>
with you <br/>
with you <br/>

i can escape <br/>
with you <br/>
with you <br/>
