I wake up one morning hungover in the understated Areeiro neighborhood. 
After stepping outside, I settle at a table for a one euro espresso shot 
and a cigarette before returning to my tiny apartment to tackle pushing
a flat song into something more interesting. "Sand of Love" had a basic 
structure, Intro/A/B/A/B. On this trip I had brought a basic Keystep MIDI 
controller, a Beatstep Pro, and some good Sennheiser headphones overseas 
to attempt to dive deep into long electronic sessions. I did anything but 
that, and on arrival "Sand Of Love" was already done and just ok. 
Frustratingly, nowhere near where I thought it could be. I stared out the 
window onto sunny clear blue skies, green trees, and a deep admiration 
for the ocean. As usual it's a calm sunny day in Portugal. As a former
hardware synth addict, I had bought the extensive Arturia synth pack so
I could use the full extent of sounds. I tried maybe 40 different synth patches
and melodies. I knew the chorus had to dramatically change. 
It was a simple transition but I was desperately needing to feel 
like I was being warped into a new reality. I wanted that feeling of 
pure mind altering psychedelic and I thought synths were the way to go. 
But Linndrum has some more interesting tones in the toms, and I thought 
why not switch the rhythm. The transition was simple enough; a rhythm would
change the entire feel. And so I attempted a couple variations of toms and 
settled on something that didn't fit but transported me somewhere authentic, 
and that's when the direction of the song started to make sense again. It was 
like I revived something dead and brought it back to life. That was truly one 
of the best breakthroughs of any song I've ever had. I also brought a Warm Audio 
microphone on this trip and tried different vocal melodies and that was it. 
Brought the track back home to Chicago to show the band and there was some 
lukewarm reaction to it. We gave it almost a year of shows before bringing it 
to full studio ready recordings. Brandon and Gio nailed the lead guitar and bass, 
but the ultimate transformation was the Roland JC-120. One late night a few days 
before heading into Andrew Humphrey's studio, Brandon plays the most beautiful 
outro solo we've ever recorded to date and that take made it to the final cut. 
Even after some more polished takes, there was a perfect charm of the notes played 
in a order that I couldn't get out of my head. Instead of a long fade out, I decided 
a tight fast fade out halfway through the solo relieved the ears a bit better 
and resolved nicely. We did end up using a synth, of course the mighty Prophet. 
With a combination of the drums, Brandon's guitars, and a few Prophet patches, 
we were able to achieve exactly what I was yearning for during my Portuguese days.

Lyrics 

reality
-
In a dream <br/>
We could be <br/>
Together forever <br/>
Together forever <br/>
But this is reality <br/>
You were in my dream <br/>

In a dream <br/>
We could be <br/>
Together forever <br/>
Together forever <br/>
But this is reality <br/>
You were in my dream <br/>

Sand Of Love
-
Carried me off the road <br/>
Down the path <br/>
I tripped on stones <br/>
Found an ocean <br/>
Fell down <br/>
Stayed down <br/>

Through the sand of love <br/>
How does it feel? <br/>
I know it's hard <br/>
To say goodbye <br/>

Down the water <br/>
Slept there all night <br/>
Found a beast in my dream <br/>
Held tight <br/>
Held tight <br/>

Through the sand of love <br/>
How does it feel? <br/>
I know it's hard <br/>
To say goodbye <br/>

Through the sand of love <br/>
How does it feel? <br/>
I know it's hard <br/>
To say goodbye <br/>

Paradise
-
Wanna travel the world with you <br/>
Leave it all behind <br/>
Living in paradise <br/>

All the roses will bloom for you <br/>
Never need to cry <br/>
Living in paradise <br/>

Never need to cry <br/>
Never need to hide <br/>
Never need to cry <br/>
Never need to hide <br/>

Always locked in away from you <br/>
Leaving me behind <br/>
Living in paradise <br/>

Morning sun will shine for you <br/>
Soak it in with time <br/>
It will be alright <br/>

Always falling apart from you <br/>
Leave it all behind <br/>
Living in paradise <br/>

Never need to cry <br/>
Never need to hide <br/>
Never need to cry <br/>
Never need to hide

Cover up me in your soft love <br/>
Cover me up in your mind <br/>
I'll always be in paradise <br/>
I'll always be in paradise <br/>

Cover me up in your soft lies <br/>
Cover me up and you're mine <br/>
I'll always be in paradise <br/>
I'll always be in paradise <br/>
